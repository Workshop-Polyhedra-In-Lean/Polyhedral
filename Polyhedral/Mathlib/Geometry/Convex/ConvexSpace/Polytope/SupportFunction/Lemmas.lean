/- ## Basic properties -/

-- scaling: TODO write down!

-- additivity: TODO write down!


-- supportFunction of ∅
-- supportFunction of singleton



-- supportFunction of Minkowski sum  ---> Rockefeller's book?

/- ## Convex closure -/
-- TODO: figure out the right variables to use!

-- if V has a nice topology... we can define convexClosure, and should have the following
-- P a set in the convex space, with a topology
-- (and hope that if V is a module, we have a convex space)
def convexClosure (P : Set V) : Set V := sorry

-- split into convex hull, and one statement about top. closure

example {P : Set V} : supportFunction R P = supportFunction R (convexClosure P) := sorry



-- example: over ℚ, take P = (0, √2) ∩ ℚ ⊆ ℚ.
-- (is not a polytope, but perhaps still an interesting set)
-- check: is a convex set over ℚ (?!)
-- our current definition returns either 0 (for a negative rational number) or "the junk value 37"
-- convex closure is (to be filled in)

/-- The interval `(0, √2) ∩ ℚ ⊆ ℚ`, whose support function is a test case for the
"special junk value" in our definition of support functions. -/
